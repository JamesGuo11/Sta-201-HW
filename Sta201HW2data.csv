Title,Abstract
Stock price prediction using k-medoids clustering with indexing dynamic time warping,"Various methods to predict stock prices have been studied. In the field of empiri- cal finance, feature values for prediction include “value” and “momentum”. In this research, we use the pattern of stock price fluctuations which has not been fully uti- lized in the financial market as the input feature of prediction. We extract the repre- sentative price fluctuation patterns with k-Medoids Clustering with Indexing Dynamic Time Warping method. This method is k-medoids clustering on dissimilarity matrix using IDTW which measures DTW distance between indexed time-series. We can visualize and grasp a price fluctuation pattern effective for prediction with the pro- posed method. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, we analyze its performance using TOPIX. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for predicting monthly stock price changes."
Stock price prediction using principal components,"The literature provides strong evidence that stock price values can be predicted from past price data. Principal component analysis (PCA) identifies a small number of principle com- ponents that explain most of the variation in a data set. This method is often used for dimensionality reduction and analysis of the data. In this paper, we develop a general method for stock price prediction using time-varying covariance information. To address the time-varying nature of financial time series, we assign exponential weights to the price data so that recent data points are weighted more heavily. Our proposed method involves a dimension-reduction operation constructed based on principle components. Projecting the noisy observation onto a principle subspace results in a well-conditioned problem. We illus- trate our results based on historical daily price data for 150 companies from different mar- ket-capitalization categories. We compare the performance of our method to two other methods: Gauss-Bayes, which is numerically demanding, and moving average, a simple method often used by technical traders and researchers. We investigate the results based on mean squared error and directional change statistic of prediction, as measures of perfor- mance, and volatility of prediction as a measure of risk."
Short-Term Stock Price Prediction Based on Limit Order Book Dynamics,"Interaction of capital market participants is a complicated dynamic process. A stochastic model is proposed to describe the dynamics to predict short-term stock price behaviors. Independent compound Poisson processes are introduced to describe the occurrences of market orders, limit orders and cancellations of limit orders, respectively. Based on high- frequency observations of the limit order book, the maximum empirical likelihood estimator (MELE) is applied to estimate the parameters of the compound Poisson processes. Moreover, an analytical formula is derived to compute the probability distribution of the first-passage time of a compound Poisson process. Based on this formula, the conditional probability of a price increase and the conditional distribution of the duration until the first change in mid-price are obtained. A novel approach of short-term stock price prediction is proposed and this methodology works reasonably well in the data analysis."
A graph-based convolutional neural network stock price prediction with leading indicators,"The stock market is a capitalistic haven where the issued shares are transferred, traded, and circulated. It bases stock prices on the issue market, however, the structure and trading activities of the stock market are much more complicated than the issue market itself. Therefore, making an accurate prediction becomes an intricate as well as highly difficult task. On the other hand, because of the potential benefits of stock prediction, it attracts generation after generation of scholars as well as investors to continuously develop various prediction meth- ods from different perspectives, a myriad of theories, a multitude of investment strategies, and different practical experiences. In this article, aiming at the task of time series (financial) feature extraction and prediction of price movements, a new convolutional novel neural network that can be called a framework to improve the prediction accuracy of stock trading is proposed. The method that is proposed is called SSACNN, a short form of stock sequence array convolu- tional neural network. SSACNN collects data including historical data of prices and its leading indicators (options/futures) for a stock to take an array as the input graph of the convolutional neural network framework. In our experimen- tal results, five Taiwanese and American stocks were used as a benchmark to compare with the previous algorithms and proposed algorithm, the motion pre- diction performance of SSACNN has been improved significantly and proved that it has the potential to be applied in the real financial market."
Deep architectures for long-term stock price prediction with a heuristic-based strategy for trading simulations,"Stock price prediction is a popular yet challenging task and deep learning provides the means to conduct the mining for the different patterns that trigger its dynamic movement. In this paper, the task is to predict the close price for 25 companies enlisted at the Bucharest Stock Exchange, from a novel data set introduced herein. Towards this scope, two tradi- tional deep learning architectures are designed in comparison: a long short-memory net- work and a temporal convolutional neural model. Based on their predictions, a trading strategy, whose decision to buy or sell depends on two different thresholds, is proposed. A hill climbing approach selects the optimal values for these parameters. The prediction of the two deep learning representatives used in the subsequent trading strategy leads to distinct facets of gain."
Multi-Model Generative Adversarial Network Hybrid Prediction Algorithm (MMGAN-HPA) for stock market prices prediction,"Deep learning has achieved greater success in optimizing solutions associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI). In the financial domain, it is widely used for stock market prediction, trade execution strategies and portfolio optimization. Stock market prediction is a very significant use case in this domain. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with advanced AI models have gained significance of late. However, it is used in image-image-translation and other computer vision scenarios. GANs are not used much for stock market prediction due to its difficulty in setting the right set of hyperparameters. In this paper, overcome this problem with reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization. A deep learning framework based on GAN, named Stock-GAN, is implemented with generator and discriminator. The former is realized with LSTM, a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), while the latter uses Convolutional Neural Network. An algorithm named Generative Adversarial Network based Hybrid Prediction Algorithm (GAN-HPA) is proposed. An empirical study revealed that Stock-GAN achieves promising performance in stock price prediction when compared with the state of the art model known as Multi-Model based Hybrid Prediction Algorithm (MM-HPA). Afterwards, MM-HPA and GAN-HPA combined to form yet another hybrid model known as MMGAN-HPA for improved performance over MM-HPA and GAN-HPA."
Short Term Stock Price Prediction in Indian Market: A Neural Network Perspective,"In recent times there has been an increasing level of debate whether patterns do exist in equity market movements and whether they can be predicted. In order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional time series models, we have focused our study on the application of non-parametric paradigms like stacked multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), long short term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM) and gated bidirectional recurrent unit (BGRU) on three NSE listed banks to predict short term stock price, and compared their performance with a shallow neural network benchmark. We have predicted equity ‘Close Prices’ five minutes into the future, using a sliding window approach and have observed that average error in predictions of MLP, LSTM, GRU, BLSTM and BGRU models, varied between 0.09% and 0.1%, indicating their superior performance with regard to benchmark baseline of 0.88%. We have used the aforementioned predictions to determine price trends, which successfully outperformed the random walk baseline accuracy of 50%."
A hybrid fuzzy intelligent agent-based system for stock price prediction,"Stock price prediction is an important task for most investors and professional analysts. However, it is a tough problem because of the uncertainties involved in prices. This paper presents a four-layer fuzzy multiagent system (FMAS) architecture to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence model based on the coordination of intelligent agents performing data preprocessing and function approximation tasks for next-day stock price prediction. The first layer is dedicated to metadata creation. The second layer is aimed at data preprocessing using stepwise regression analysis and self-organizing map neural network clustering for modularizing prediction problems. The third layer is aimed at model building for each cluster using genetic fuzzy systems and evaluating built models to choose the best evolved fuzzy system for each cluster. Finally, the fourth layer provides model analysis and knowledge presentation. The capability of FMAS is evaluated by applying it on stock price data gathered from IT and airline sectors and comparing the outcomes with the results of other methods. The results show that FMAS outperforms all previous methods, so it can be considered as a suitable tool for stock price prediction problems. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
COVID19-HPSMP: COVID-19 adopted Hybrid and Parallel deep information fusion framework for stock price movement prediction,"The novel of coronavirus (COVID-19) has suddenly and abruptly changed the world as we knew at the start of the 3rd decade of the 21st century. Particularly, COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected financial econometrics and stock markets across the globe. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)-based prediction models, especially Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures, have the potential to act as a key enabling factor to reduce the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and future possible ones on financial markets. In this regard, first, a unique COVID-19 related PRIce MOvement prediction (COVID19 PRIMO) dataset is introduced in this paper, which incorporates effects of social media trends related to COVID-19 on stock market price movements. Afterwards, a novel hybrid and parallel DNN-based framework is proposed that integrates different and diversified learning architectures. Referred to as the COVID-19 adopted Hybrid and Parallel deep fusion framework for Stock price Movement Prediction (COVID19-HPSMP), innovative fusion strategies are used to combine scattered social media news related to COVID-19 with historical mark data. The proposed COVID19-HPSMP consists of two parallel paths (hence hybrid), one based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Local/Global Attention modules, and one integrated CNN and Bi-directional Long Short term Memory (BLSTM) path. The two parallel paths are followed by a multilayer fusion layer acting as a fusion center that combines localized features. Performance evaluations are performed based on the introduced COVID19 PRIMO dataset illustrating superior performance of the proposed framework."
Pattern graph tracking-based stock price prediction using big data,"Stock price forecasting is the most difficult field owing to irregularities. However, because stock prices sometimes show similar patterns and are determined by a variety of factors, we propose determining similar patterns in historical stock data to achieve daily stock prices with high prediction accuracy and potential rules for selecting the main factors that significantly affect the price, while simultaneously considering all factors. This study is intended at suggesting a new complex methodology that finds the optimal historical dataset with similar patterns according to various algorithms for each stock item and provides a more accurate prediction of daily stock price. First, we use a Dynamic Time Warping algorithm to find patterns with the most similar situation adjacent to a current pattern. Second, we select the determinants most affected by the stock price using feature selection based on Stepwise Regression Analysis. Moreover, we generate an artificial neural network model with selected features as training data for predicting the best stock price. Finally, we use Jaro–Winkler distance with Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) as a prediction accuracy measure to verify the accuracy of our model."
Knowledge graph and deep learning combined with a stock price prediction network focusing on related stocks and mutation points,"Due to the interaction of many factors in the stock market, stock price prediction has always been a chal- lenging problem in the field of machine learning. In particular, the mutation factors of the stock market often have a great impact on subsequent predictions. The existing prediction models seldom consider the impacts of other stocks in the stock market and mutation points on the prediction accuracy of target stocks. Therefore, this paper presents a new knowledge graph and deep learning method combined with a stock price prediction network focusing on related stocks and mutation points. First, the target stock price features are obtained through the ConvLSTM network. Second, the knowledge graph is used to mine the hidden relationships between stocks to find the stocks relevant to the target stock to obtain the mar- ket information vector and the market information features through the ConvLSTM network. Then, we find the mutation points according to the price change range, construct the mutation point distance weight matrix according to the distance from each trading day to the mutation points, and obtain the mutation point information features through the graph convolutional network (GCN). Finally, the fea- tures of market information, mutation point information and target stock price are fused to jointly predict the future stock price. The experimental results on the A share of Shenzhen from 2010 to 2019 show that the algorithm has good robustness and that the prediction accuracy is effectively improved."
Automated news reading: Stock price prediction based on financial news using context-capturing features,"We examine whether stock price prediction based on textual information in financial news can be improved as previous approaches only yield prediction accuracies close to guessing probability. Accordingly, we enhance existing text mining methods by using more expressive features to represent text and by employing market feed- back as part of our feature selection process. We show that a robust feature selection allows lifting classification accuracies significantly above previous approaches when combined with complex feature types. This is because our approach allows selecting semantically relevant features and thus, reduces the problem of over-fitting when applying a machine learning approach. We also demonstrate that our approach is highly profitable for trading in practice. The methodology can be transferred to any other application area providing textual information and corresponding effect data"
The impact of word sense disambiguation on stock price prediction,"State-of-the-art decision support systems for stock price prediction incorporate pattern-based event detection in text into their predictions. These systems typically fail to account for word meaning, even though word sense disambiguation is crucial for text understanding. Therefore, we propose an advanced natural language processing pipeline for event-based stock price prediction, that allows for word sense disambiguation to be incorporated in the event detection process. We identify events in natural language news messages and subsequently weight these events for their historical impact on stock prices. We assess the merit of word sense disambiguation in event-based stock price prediction in two evaluation scenarios for NASDAQ-100 companies, based on historical stock prices and news articles retrieved from Dow Jones Newswires over a 2-year period. We evaluate the precision of generated buy and sell signals based on our predicted stock price movements, as well as the excess returns generated by a trading strategy that acts upon these signals. Event-based stock price predictions seem most reliable about 2 days into the future. The number of detected events tends to reduce with over 30% when graph-based word sense disambiguation using a degree centrality measure is applied in the event detection process, thus reducing the noise introduced into the stock price movement predictions by high-impact ambiguous events. As a result, modest improvements in the precision of buy and sell signals generated based on these predictions tend to lead to vast improvements of on average about 70% in the associated excess returns."
Deep learning-based feature engineering for stock price movement prediction,"Stock price modeling and prediction have been challenging objectives for researchers and speculators because of noisy and non-stationary characteristics of samples. With the growth in deep learning, the task of feature learning can be performed more effectively by purposely designed network. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end model named multi-filters neural network (MFNN) specifically for feature extraction on financial time series samples and price movement prediction task. Both convolutional and recurrent neurons are integrated to build the multi-filters structure, so that the information from different feature spaces and market views can be obtained. We apply our MFNN for extreme market prediction and signal-based trading simulation tasks on Chinese stock market index CSI 300. Experimental results show that our network outperforms traditional machine learning models, statistical models, and single-structure(convolutional, recurrent, and LSTM) networks in terms of the accuracy, profitability, and stability."
A graph-based CNN-LSTM stock price prediction algorithm with leading indicators,"In today’s society, investment wealth management has become a mainstream of the contemporary era. Investment wealth management refers to the use of funds by investors to arrange funds reasonably, for example, savings, bank financial products, bonds, stocks, commodity spots, real estate, gold, art, and many others. Wealth management tools manage and assign families, individuals, enterprises, and institutions to achieve the purpose of increasing and maintaining value to accelerate asset growth. Among them, in investment and financial management, people’s favorite product of investment often stocks, because the stock market has great advantages and charm, especially compared with other investment methods. More and more scholars have developed methods of prediction from multiple angles for the stock market. According to the feature of financial time series and the task of price prediction, this article proposes a new framework structure to achieve a more accurate prediction of the stock price, which combines Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Long–Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM). This new method is aptly named stock sequence array convolutional LSTM (SACLSTM). It constructs a sequence array of historical data and its leading indicators (options and futures), and uses the array as the input image of the CNN framework, and extracts certain feature vectors through the convolutional layer and the layer of pooling, and as the input vector of LSTM, and takes ten stocks in U.S.A and Taiwan as the experimental data. Compared with previous methods, the prediction performance of the proposed algorithm in this article leads to better results when compared directly."
Stock price prediction using the RNN model,"This paper proposes a deep learning technique to predict the stock market. Since RNN has the advantage of being able to process time series data, it is very suitable for forecasting stocks. Therefore, we use the RNN network and use Apple's stock price in the past ten years as data set to predict. Experiments show that the prediction accuracy is over 95%, and the loss close to 0.1%."
S_I_LSTM: stock price prediction based on multiple data sources and sentiment analysis,"Stocks price prediction is a current hot spot with great promise and challenges. Recently, there have been many stock price predic- tion methods. However, the prediction accuracy of these methods is still far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a stock price prediction method that incorporates multiple data sources and the investor sentiment, which can be called S_I_LSTM. Firstly, we crawl multiple data sources on the Internet and preprocess them respec- tively. These data involve stock historical data, technical indicators, and non-traditional data sources, such as stock posts and financial news. Then, we use the sentiment analysis method based on con- volutional neural network for the non-traditional data, which can calculate the investors’ sentiment index. Finally, we combine senti- ment index, technical indicators and stock historical transaction data as the feature set of stock price prediction and adopt the long short- term memory network for predicting the China Shanghai A-share market. The experiments show that the predicted stock closing price is closer to the true closing price than the single data source, and the mean absolute error can achieve 2.386835, which is better than tra- ditional methods. We verified the effectiveness on the real data sets of five listed companies."
Stock Price Prediction Based on CPP-GAM,"Based on the generalized additive model, we propose a CPP-GAM algorithm which transforms the non-linear problem into a linear one. We apply this algorithm to predict the closing price of international and domestic stocks. We train the history data of stocks through back-fitting algorithm. In order to make the effect of prediction better, we get trend lines based on the method of changing point prediction, the regressive algorithm of OLS, and the Fourier series. Through a large number of empirical data analysis, we found the predictive accuracy of CPP-GAM algorithm is 89%, which is 15% higher than that of RBN、SVM、SSA-SVM and so on."
A novel hybrid model based on Hodrick– Prescott filter and support vector regression algorithm for optimizing stock market price prediction,"Predicting stock market price is considered as a challenging task of financial time series analysis, which is of great interest to stock investors, stock traders and applied research- ers. Many machine learning techniques have been used in this area to predict the stock market price, including regression algorithms which can be useful tools to provide good performance of financial time series prediction. Support Vector Regression is one of the most powerful algorithms in machine learning. There have been countless suc- cesses in utilizing SVR algorithm for stock market prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach based on machine learning and filtering techniques. Our proposed approach combines Support Vector Regression and Hodrick–Prescott filter
in order to optimize the prediction of stock price. To assess the performance of this proposed approach, we have conducted several experiments using real world datasets. The principle objective of this paper is to demonstrate the improvement in predictive performance of stock market and verify the works of our proposed model in compari- son with other optimized models. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm constitutes a powerful model for predicting stock market prices."
Comparison of ARIMA and Artificial Neural Networks Models for Stock Price Prediction,This paper examines the forecasting performance of ARIMA and artificial neural networks model with published stock data obtained from New York Stock Exchange. The empirical results obtained reveal the superiority of neural networks model over ARIMA model. The findings further resolve and clarify contradictory opinions reported in literature over the superiority of neural networks and ARIMA model and vice versa.
Stock price prediction using geometric Brownian motion,"Geometric Brownian motion is a mathematical model for predicting the future price of stock. The phase that done before stock price prediction is determine stock expected price formulation and determine the confidence level of 95%. On stock price prediction using geometric Brownian Motion model, the algorithm starts from calculating the value of return, followed by estimating value of volatility and drift, obtain the stock price forecast, calculating the forecast MAPE, calculating the stock expected price and calculating the confidence level of 95%. Based on the research, the output analysis shows that geometric Brownian motion model is the prediction technique with high rate of accuracy. It is proven with forecast MAPE value ≤ 20%."
Short-Term Stock Price Prediction Based on CAE-LSTM Method,"Artificial intelligence methods are important tools for mining information for forecasting in the stock market. Most of the literature related to short-term stock price prediction focuses on the technical data, but in the real market, many individual investors make investment decisions more from stock price shape characteristics rather than specific stock price values. Compared with traditional measurement methods, deep neural networks perform better in processing high-dimensional complex data such as images. This paper proposes a model that combines CAE (convolutional autoencoder) and LSTM (long short-term memory) neural network, uses CAE to extract stock price image feature data, and combines technical data to predict short-term stock prices. The results show that the CAE-LSTM model, based on stock price image morphological feature data and technical data, performs well in short-term stock price prediction and has good generalization ability. The root mean square error of the CAE-LSTM model decreased by about 4% from that of LSTM. CAE-LSTM models have better predictive power than LSTM models that only use technical indicator data as valid inputs."
Grey Wolf optimization-Elman neural network model for stock price prediction,"Over the past two decades, assessing future price of stock market has been a very active area of research in financial world. Stock price always fluctuates due to many variables. Thus, an accurate prediction of stock price can be considered as a tough task. This study intends to design an efficient model for predicting future price of stock market using technical indicators derived from historical data and natural inspired algorithm. The model adopts Elman neural network (ENN) because of its ability to memorize the past information, which is suitable for solving stock problems. Trial and error-based method is widely used to determine the parameters of ENN. It is a time-consuming task. To address such an issue, this study employs Grey Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm to optimize the parameters of ENN. Optimized ENN is utilized to predict the future price of stock data in 1 day advance. To evaluate the prediction efficiency, proposed model is tested on NYSE and NASDAQ stock data. The efficacy of the proposed model is compared with other benchmark models such as FPA-ELM, PSO-MLP, PSOElman, CSO-ARMA and GA-LSTM to prove its superiority. Results demonstrated that the GWO-ENN model provides accurate prediction for 1 day ahead prediction and outperforms the benchmark models taken for comparison."
Clustering-enhanced stock price prediction using deep learning,"In recent years, artificial intelligence technologies have been successfully applied in time series prediction and analytic tasks. At the same time, a lot of attention has been paid to financial time series prediction, which targets the development of novel deep learning models or optimize the forecasting results. To optimize the accuracy of stock price predic- tion, in this paper, we propose a clustering-enhanced deep learning framework to predict stock prices with three matured deep learning forecasting models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The proposed framework considers the clustering as the forecasting pre-processing, which can improve the quality of the training models. To achieve the effective clustering, we propose a new similarity measure, called Logistic Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (LWDTW), by extending a Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (WDTW) method to capture the relative importance of return observations when calculating distance matrices. Especially, based on the empirical distributions of stock returns, the cost weight function of WDTW is modified with logistic probability density distribution function. In addition, we further implement the clustering-based forecasting framework with the above three deep learning models. Finally, extensive experiments on daily US stock price data sets show that our framework has achieved excellent forecasting performance with overall best results for the combination of Logistic WDTW clustering and LSTM model using 5 different evaluation metrics."
Machine Learning Approaches in Stock Price Prediction: A Systematic Review,"Prediction of stock prices is one of the most researched topics and gathers interest from academia and the industry alike. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence, various algorithms have been employed in order to predict the equity market movement. The combined application of statistics and machine learning algorithms have been designed either for predicting the opening price of the stock the very next day or understanding the long term market in the future. This paper explores the different techniques that are used in the prediction of share prices from traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to neural networks and graph-based approaches. It draws a detailed analysis of the techniques employed in predicting the stock prices as well as explores the challenges entailed along with the future scope of work in the domain."
Impact of chart image characteristics on stock price prediction with a convolutional neural network,"Stock price prediction has long been the subject of research because of the importance of accuracy of prediction and the difficulty in forecasting. Traditionally, forecasting has involved linear models such as AR and MR or nonlinear models such as ANNs using standardized numerical data such as corporate financial data and stock price data. Due to the difficulty of securing a sufficient variety of data, researchers have recently begun using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with stock price graph images only. However, we know little about which characteristics of stock charts affect the accuracy of predictions and to what extent. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of stock chart characteristics on stock price prediction via CNNs. To this end, we define the image characteristics of stock charts and identify significant differences in prediction performance for each characteristic. The results reveal that the accuracy of prediction is improved by utilizing solid lines, color, and a single image without axis marks. Based on these findings, we describe the implications of making predictions only with images, which are unstructured data, without using large amounts of standardized data. Finally, we identify issues for future research."
"The two-stage machine learning ensemble models for stock price prediction by combining mode decomposition, extreme learning machine and improved harmony search algorithm.","As stock data is characterized by highly noisy and non-stationary, stock price prediction is regarded as a knotty problem. In this paper, we propose new two-stage ensemble models by combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) (or variational mode decomposition (VMD)), extreme learning machine (ELM) and improved harmony search (IHS) algorithm for stock price prediction, which are respectively named EMD-ELM-IHS and VMD-ELM-IHS. Furthermore, to demonstrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed models, the results were compared with those obtained by other methods, including EMD based ELM (EMD-ELM), VMD based ELM (VMD-ELM), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), ELM, multi-layer perception (MLP), support vector regression (SVR), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. The results show that the proposed models have superior performance in terms of its accuracy and stability as compared to the other models. Also, we find that the sizes of sliding window and training set have a significant impact on the predictive performance."
A Deep Neural Network for Stock Price Prediction,"The stock market is a large, complex system that consists of many human factors. Due to the human action's randomness to the market environment, the market behavior is usually erratic. In this case, many previous works were trying to find out an automatic prediction model that can capture relationships between stock market prices and the surroundings of the stock markets. Recently, a simple LSTM-attention mechanism was proposed to advance the prediction accuracy of previous works. However, the simple LSTM with attention mechanism only demonstrates how the past data influence the next. This forward-only relationship does not reflect a backward relationship, which is how the future data is related to the past data. To enforce the backward relationship on the attention-LSTM model, a multilayer bidirectional LSTM model with an attention mechanism is proposed. A bidirectional LSTM layer that can encode the data relationship in both directions is leveraged. Then attention mechanism is applied to introduce the model with the ability to focus on critical content and ignore the disturbance. Experimental result shows that the attention-BiLSTM model has a coefficient of the determinant of 0.9940, which is better than the baselines."
"Stock Price Prediction Using ARIMA, Neural Network and LSTM Models","Since the past decades, prediction of stock price has been an important and challenging task to yield the most significant profit for a company. In the era of big data, predicting the stock price using machine learning has become popular among the financial analysts since the accuracy of the prediction can be improved using these techniques. In this paper, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), neural network (NN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) have been used to predict Bursa Malaysia's closing prices data from 2/1/2020 to 19/1/2021. All the models will be evaluated using root mean square errors (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE). The results showed that LSTM able to generate more than 90% of accuracy in predicting stock prices during this pandemic period."
